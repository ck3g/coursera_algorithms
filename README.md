# Algoritms, Part 1 Coursera Course

## Quick Find

### Complexity:

  O(n²) - process sequence of N union commands to N objects

## Quick Union

### Complexity:

  O(n) - worst case is then the tree is too tall

## Weighted Quick Union

### Complexity

  O(lg₂n) - depth of any node `x` is at most lg₂n


## Selection Sort O(n²)

## Insertion Sort O(n²)

## Shell Sort

### Complexity

O(n³/₂) - for sequence of "3x + 1"

## Knuth Shuffle O(n)

## Merge Sort (N log N)

## QuickSort

Worst case complexity: O(¹/₂N²)

Average case complexity: O(~1.39 Nlg₂N)

### Dijskra 3-way sort

Avoid quadratic time for sorting array with a lot of duplicate keys

## Selection
